A configurable and modular LED matrix grid.

All parameters, like x/y dimensions, cell spacing, wall hight, edge wall
configuration, etc. can be modified. Multiple modules may be combined to
form a bigger grid.

This project was primarily created as a way to learn the basics of OpenSCAD,
so do not expect the most elegant and efficient code.
